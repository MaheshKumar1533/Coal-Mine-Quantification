            <div class="sub-section" data-info="Electric vehicles (EVs) are used across various sectors, including personal transportation, commercial and fleet operations, public transportation, and specialized applications. They are popular in personal use for their environmental benefits, lower costs, and convenience, especially in urban areas. EVs are also being adopted in commercial fleets for delivery, ride-sharing, and corporate use due to cost savings and sustainability goals. Public transportation systems like buses and shuttles are transitioning to electric to reduce emissions. Specialized vehicles, such as emergency services, agriculture, and construction equipment, are also increasingly electric. EVs contribute to environmental goals by reducing greenhouse gas emissions and integrating with renewable energy systems. The growth of charging infrastructure and policy support is driving further adoption of EVs, making them a crucial part of a sustainable transportation future.">

            <div class="sub-section" data-info="Methane capture systems are technologies designed to capture and utilize methane gas, a potent greenhouse gas, from sources like landfills, agriculture, and the oil and gas industry. Methane has a much higher global warming potential than carbon dioxide, making its capture and management crucial for mitigating climate change.

                    These systems work by collecting methane emissions that would otherwise escape into the atmosphere and converting them into useful energy, such as electricity or heat. By doing so, methane capture systems help reduce greenhouse gas emissions, improve air quality, and provide an additional source of renewable energy. They play a vital role in efforts to achieve carbon neutrality and reduce the environmental impact of human activities.">

Renewable energy is also inexhaustible, promoting energy security and reducing dependence on imported fuels. While initial installation costs can be high and some sources are intermittent or geographically limited, renewable energy systems have low operating costs and offer long-term economic and environmental benefits. They are essential for a sustainable future and transitioning to a cleaner, greener energy economy.">
